About

Strogonoff is a Go package to hide text on JPEG images.

It is called Strogonoff because the technique of sending information by concealing the message is called *Stenography* and this package was implemented with *Go* language. Besides that, I love *strogonoff*, a typical Brazilian meal.


Implementation
--------------

99% of the code is from go lang "image/jpeg" package. I modified it to encode the information on the highest AC frequency of the brightness channel for each 8x8 block, since the human eye is not well suited to perceive brightness differences on small regions.
